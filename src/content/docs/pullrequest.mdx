## Creating a Pull Request on GitHub

1. **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the target repository on GitHub.

2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone {your-fork-url}
   ```

3. **Create a New Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b {your-branch-name}
   ```

4. **Make Your Changes:** Make your desired code changes, commit them, and push the branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   git push origin {your-branch-name}
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request on GitHub:** Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub, and you should see a banner prompting you to create a pull request. Click the button to open the pull request form. Select the target branch (usually `main` or `develop`) and add a title and description or optionaly images with changes. Submit the pull request.

## Useful Tips

- Use clear and concise commit messages.
- Keep your branches small and focused on a single feature or bug fix.
- Keep the file formatting with the person you made the pull request to

1. Verify the status actually in your computer:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. Compares the changes between different versions of a file and the staging area:

   ```bash
   git diff {file}
   ```

- Or compare the working directory with the last commit.

  ```bash
  git diff HEAD
  ```

3. Displays a log of all commits made to the repository.

   ```bash
   git log
   ```

- Displays a more accurate version of the history.

  ```bash
  git log --oneline
  ```

- It displays the history as a graph, showing branches and merges.

  ```bash
  git log --graph
  ```

4. Displays the changes made to a specific commit.

   ```bash
   git show {commit}
   ```

5. Shows who made each change to a specific line in a file.

   ```bash
   git blame {file}
   ```

6. Helps to find the exact confirmation where an error was entered.

   ```bash
   git bisect
   ```

7. Change the active branch to the specified commit and update your working directory with the files of that version. ⚠Be careful!⚠ This command overwrites uncommitted changes.

   ```bash
   git checkout {hash}
   ```

8. Displays a log of all commits made to the repository, including commits that are no longer referenced by any branch. This can be useful for recovering lost commits.

   ```bash
   git reflog
   ```
